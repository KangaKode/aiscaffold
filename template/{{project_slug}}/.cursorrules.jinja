## Quick Reference

- Architecture-first: review docs/ARCHITECTURE.md before making changes
- Layering: {% set layer_list = layers.split(',') %}{{ layer_list | join(' -> ') }} (enforced by tests/test_architecture.py)
- Files under 500 lines, use dataclasses, parse at boundaries
- Always provide complete code, never placeholders
- Add logging for debugging

## Pointers

- Architecture: [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md)
- Testing: [docs/TESTING_STANDARDS.md](docs/TESTING_STANDARDS.md)
- Quality: [docs/QUALITY_SCORE.md](docs/QUALITY_SCORE.md)
