description: Example cursor rule. Shows the format for domain-specific rules. Replace this with your own rules for core systems.

# example-rule

This is a template showing the format for `.cursor/rules/*.mdc` files.
These files use YAML frontmatter for progressive disclosure:
- The `description` field is always loaded (Level 1)
- The body is loaded only when relevant (Level 2)

## How to Create Your Own Rules

1. Create a new `.mdc` file in `.cursor/rules/`
2. Add a YAML frontmatter `description` that explains WHEN this rule applies
3. Add the detailed rules in the body
4. Delete this example file once you have real rules

## Example Format

```yaml

# auth-system

1. Authentication Flow
- JWT tokens with 24h expiry
- Refresh tokens stored in HTTP-only cookies
- Role-based access: admin, editor, viewer

2. Security Rules
- Always validate tokens before accessing protected resources
- Never store plain-text passwords
- Use bcrypt for password hashing
```
